/* In this project, I have explored some basic statistics about IPL 2019 and I have tried to answer one question in particular: 
'Do batsmen struggle against balls that spin away as compared to balls spinning into them? '
This notion has been the reason for many bowling changes and even in team selection in recent matches and is talked about a lot.

/* The effect of the the theory 'batsmen struggle against balls turning away' can be seen immediately in the number of balls faced by batsmen.
Of the approximately 6000 balls bowled by spinners, batsmen have played around 3500 balls spinning away and around 2500 spinning into them.

The numbers do not support the theory. 
Batsmen have a higher strike rate and average when the ball is turning away.
Bowlers who turn the ball into the batsmen have a better economy.
Right arm off spinners and left arm chinaman bowlers:
  When bowling to right hand batsmen(ball turns in):Economy:7.12 and Strike Rate:17.58 i.e a wicket every 3 overs(best figures for bowlers in the table)
  when bowling to left hand batsmen(ball turns away): Batsman Average:33.25(2nd Best,highest-33.87) batsman Strike Rate:144.1 (Best in the table)
Despite bowling about 1000 balls less, bowlers who turn the ball into the batsmen have taken only 21 wickets less compared bowlers turning away.
Left hand batsmen against spinners: very close batting average and bowler strike rates. However the batsmen have scored at a faster rate against balls turning away. 
Right Hand Batsmen on average score 10 runs more against bowlers turning away.

The numbers clearly are not in favor of the theory when considering IPL2019. 

Other things to be noted are: Right hand batsmen facing medium pacers and fast bowlers account for 45% of all balls and this combination has the best batting average
Left Handers have scored faster and more runs on average against spinners as compared to right handers
Right handers have better numbers than left handers against medium pace and fast bowlers in IPL 2019*/
